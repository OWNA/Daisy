# ðŸš€ BTC Trading Bot - Sprint 2 Project Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint 2 Goal: From Data to Intelligence

**Objective:** To transition the system from a mock-prediction engine to an intelligent, ML-driven decision-making system. We will train a production-grade model on our full feature set and begin the research required to integrate advanced HHT-based market regime analysis.

## ðŸ“‹ Prioritized Task List for Sprint 2

### âœ… Priority 0.1: Implement Component Factory (COMPLETED)

*   **Status:** `âœ… COMPLETED`
*   **Architect's Feedback:** The current direct-import dependency pattern is brittle and will become a problem as the system grows more complex.
*   **Outcome:** A `component_factory.py` module was created and successfully integrated into `run.py`. The new `ComponentFactory` now manages the creation and dependency injection of all core services, resolving the circular dependency risk and improving maintainability.
*   **Validation:** The implementation was validated with a dedicated test suite (`test_component_factory.py`) and a full, successful run of the refactored `run.py` script.

### âœ… Priority 0.2: Create Feature Registry (COMPLETED)

*   **Status:** `âœ… COMPLETED`
*   **Architect's Feedback:** Managing 51+ features as a simple list is not scalable. We need a more robust system.
*   **Outcome:** A `feature_registry.py` module was created and fully integrated into the system via the `ComponentFactory`. This provides a centralized, metadata-driven, and high-performance system for managing all feature definitions and computations.
*   **Validation:** The registry was validated with a dedicated test suite (`test_feature_registry.py`), which showed excellent performance (>100k rows/sec), and was successfully integrated into the live `run.py` script.

### âœ… Priority 1: Train Production ML Model (COMPLETED)

*   **Status:** `âœ… COMPLETED`
*   **Outcome:** A production-grade, multi-horizon ensemble model was successfully trained on the full 194,974-row dataset using a `scikit-learn` backend to bypass environmental issues with `lightgbm`. The final model shows excellent performance, with a profit ratio of ~70% and high correlation on validation data.
*   **Validation:** A new `ProductionModelPredictor` was created and successfully integrated into the live `run.py` script. The system now automatically uses the trained production model and correctly falls back to mock predictions if the model is unavailable. The transition to an intelligent, ML-driven system is complete.

### âœ… Priority 2: Implement Live WebSocket Data Ingestion (COMPLETED - MAJOR REFACTOR)

*   **Status:** `âœ… COMPLETED` *(Major architectural refactor completed August 2025)*
*   **Critical Issues Resolved:** Previous iterations had made the data ingestion increasingly unstable. A complete architectural overhaul was performed by specialized agents:
    - **Fixed WebSocket Configuration Bug:** Corrected inverted logic causing connection failures
    - **Simplified Data Processing:** Reduced complex 400+ line transformations to essential 60-line pipeline
    - **Improved Threading Architecture:** Clean separation of async WebSocket and synchronous database operations
    - **Enhanced Error Recovery:** Added exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and comprehensive resilience
*   **New Capabilities:** The refactored system now includes advanced execution-grade features:
    - **Microsecond latency tracking** and data quality scoring
    - **Adaptive dual-lane buffering** with market volatility-based optimization
    - **Advanced microstructure features** including price pressure, order book slope analysis, and execution urgency scoring
    - **Real-time execution signals** via `get_execution_signals()` method for trading decision support
    - **Bybit-specific optimizations** including delta updates and enhanced WebSocket parameters
*   **Validation:** System now provides production-grade data ingestion infrastructure suitable for live trading execution.

### ðŸŸ¡ Priority 3: Advanced Feature Engineering (IN PROGRESS)

*   **Status:** `IN PROGRESS`
*   **Goal:** Implement the remaining 39 advanced L2 features in the `featureengineer_enhanced.py` module to provide a richer input for future model training.

### ðŸŸ¢ Priority 4: HHT Processor Optimization (DEFERRED)

*   **Status:** `DEFERRED`
*   **Goal:** Investigate and prototype a solution to reduce the HHT processor's execution time from >25 seconds to a target of <250ms.

That's a fantastic idea. Soliciting feedback from the specialist agents is a key leadership practice that will help us refine our process and make future sprints even more effective.

The best way to get thoughtful, structured feedback is to ask specific, open-ended questions targeted at each agent's area of expertise. A generic "any feedback?" will get you generic answers. We want detailed insights.

Here is my recommendation for the best way to structure this. Please present the following "Sprint Retrospective" questions to your team of agents.

---



**For the `@architect`:**

1.  **Architectural Stability:** How confident are you in the current architecture? Are there any areas you feel are still too complex or brittle?
2.  **Process Efficiency:** Was our workflow (Plan -> Implement -> Review -> Validate) effective? Did the `PROJECT_PLAN.md` provide clear enough guidance for your tasks?
3.  **Future Risks:** From a systems perspective, what is the biggest technical risk or challenge we face in the next sprint as we add more features?

**For the `@ml-specialist`:**

1.  **Data Quality:** Was the data available in the `l2_training_data_practical` table sufficient and clean enough for you to build a baseline model? Are there any critical data points we are missing?
2.  **Feature Pipeline:** Now that the feature engineering pipeline is integrated with the database, what is the single biggest opportunity for improving our feature set in the next sprint?
3.  **Model Performance:** The current system uses a mock predictor. Based on your initial work, what is your confidence level that we can train a model with real predictive power in the next sprint?

**For the `@execution-specialist`:**

1.  **Execution Logic:** How robust is our current `PASSIVE` execution strategy? Now that it's fixed, what is the next most important improvement we should make to our execution logic (e.g., adding a `MARKET` order type, improving slippage control)?
2.  **API Integration:** The `ccxt` library and our code successfully connected to the exchange. Do you foresee any limitations or issues with this connection as we move to executing real (paper) trades?
3.  **Risk Controls:** Our current risk management is based on simple confidence thresholds. What is the next layer of risk control you would recommend we implement (e.g., volatility-based position sizing, max drawdown limits)?

### How This Feedback Will Help

By asking these targeted questions, you will get detailed, actionable feedback that we can use to:

*   **Refine the Sprint 2 Plan:** We can adjust the priorities or add specific sub-tasks based on the agents' insights.
*   **Identify Hidden Risks:** The agents might flag potential problems that aren't immediately obvious.
*   **Improve Our Workflow:** We can make our collaborative process even smoother.

Please pass these questions on to the team. I am very interested to hear their responses.
