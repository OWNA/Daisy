python setup_trading_agents.py

# Install additional agent dependencies
pip install -r agent_requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Activate Your A-Team
```bash
# Activate the focused 3-agent team
claude-code team activate a-team

# Verify team is active
claude-code team status
```

## 🎯 Your 3-Agent A-Team

### 🏗️ Trading Systems Architect

- **Focus**: Order execution, market impact, risk management

## 🛠️ Immediate Actions You Can Take

### 1. System Analysis (Start Here)
```bash
# Get comprehensive system analysis
claude-code chat architect "Analyze my current BTC trading system files and identify the main issues"

# Understand your ML model problems
claude-code chat ml-specialist "Analyze my LightGBM model performance and suggest improvements"

# Review execution issues
claude-code chat execution-specialist "Analyze my current order execution and suggest optimizations"
```

### 2. Daily Team Coordination
```bash
# Morning standup with all 3 agents
claude-code team workflow daily-standup

# Weekly system review
claude-code chat architect,ml-specialist,execution-specialist "Weekly system performance review"
```

### 3. Specific Problem Solving
```bash
# Fix database schema issues
claude-code chat architect "Help me fix the inconsistent SQLite schema"

# Improve model features
claude-code chat ml-specialist "Create better L2 order book features to reduce false signals"

# Optimize execution
claude-code chat execution-specialist "Implement smart order placement for Bybit"
```

## 📁 Your System Context

Based on your existing files, the agents understand you have:
- **LightGBM Models**: `lgbm_model_*.txt` files
- **L2 Data Collection**: `l2_data_collector.py`
- **Feature Engineering**: `featureengineer.py`
- **Model Training**: `modeltrainer.py`
- **Database**: `trading_bot.db` (SQLite)
- **Configuration**: `config.yaml`
- **Main Trading Logic**: `main.py`
- **Execution**: `smartorderexecutor.py`

## 🎯 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Immediate Analysis (Week 1)
```bash
# System audit
claude-code chat architect "Audit my current system architecture and create consolidation plan"

# Model diagnosis
claude-code chat ml-specialist "Diagnose why my LightGBM model has false signals"

# Execution analysis
claude-code chat execution-specialist "Analyze my current execution performance and slippage"
```

### Phase 2: Core Improvements (Week 2-3)
```bash
# Start refactoring
claude-code chat architect "Begin consolidating duplicate code and improving file organization"

# Enhance features
claude-code chat ml-specialist "Implement new L2 features to reduce false signals"

# Smart execution
claude-code chat execution-specialist "Implement passive order strategies for better fills"
```

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Week 4)
```bash
# System integration
claude-code chat architect,ml-specialist,execution-specialist "Integrate all improvements and test system"

# Performance validation
claude-code chat architect,ml-specialist,execution-specialist "Validate system performance improvements"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Claude Code CLI is Not Working
1. Check your API key is set: `claude-code auth login`
2. Verify team is activated: `claude-code team status`
3. Check agent files exist: `ls .claude/agents/`

### If Agents Don't Understand Your System
```bash
# Share system context
claude-code context share --team a-team "BTC trading system with LightGBM, Bybit WebSocket, SQLite database"

# Set specific context for each agent
claude-code context set architect "100+ files to consolidate, SQLite schema issues"
claude-code context set ml-specialist "LightGBM false signals, L2 order book features"
claude-code context set execution-specialist "Simple market orders, need smart execution"
```

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### Week 1 Results

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Get help from any agent
claude-code chat architect "I need help with [specific issue]"
claude-code chat ml-specialist "How do I [specific task]?"
claude-code chat execution-specialist "Can you help me [specific problem]?"

# Team consultation
claude-code chat architect,ml-specialist,execution-specialist "I need help with [complex issue]"
```

### Common Issues & Solutions
