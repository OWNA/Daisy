## 📅 Sprint Schedule

### **Day 1-2: System Analysis**
**Agent:** Trading Systems Architect
```bash
Task: subagent=btc-trading-system-architect Perform comprehensive analysis of the current codebase. Identify all duplicate functionality, map data flows, and create a consolidation plan prioritizing the most critical issues.
```

### **Day 3-4: Database & Architecture Design**
**Agent:** Trading Systems Architect
```bash
Task: subagent=btc-trading-system-architect Design the new architecture. Create database schema migrations, module structure, and integration plan. Focus on L2 data flow from Bybit to execution.
```

### **Day 5: Implementation Planning**
**All Agents Collaboration**
```bash
Task: Create a coordinated implementation plan where the System Architect's changes support the ML and Execution specialists' needs.
```

### **Day 6-7: Core Consolidation**
**Human Team + Architect Agent**
- Implement core module consolidation
- Test each change incrementally
- Preserve all working functionality

### **Day 8-9: Model Enhancement**
**Agent:** ML Model Enhancement Specialist
```bash
Task: subagent=quant-ml-trading-enhancer Analyze current LightGBM model performance. Design new L2 features, ensemble architecture, and validation framework. Focus on reducing false signals.
```

### **Day 10-11: Execution Optimization**
**Agent:** Execution Optimization Specialist
```bash
Task: subagent=crypto-execution-optimizer Design smart order execution system. Create algorithms for passive order placement, position sizing based on liquidity, and slippage reduction strategies.
```

### **Day 12-13: Integration & Testing**
