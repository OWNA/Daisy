# Bitcoin L2 Trading System Status Report

## Current State: OPERATIONAL WITH FIXES

### ✅ Completed Phases
1. **Phase 1: Audit** - Complete system analysis done
2. **Phase 2: Restructuring** - Reduced from 100 to 10 core files
3. **Critical Bug Fixes:**
   - Fixed all import and method errors
   - Resolved feature count mismatches
   - **Discovered and fixed target leakage** (model was seeing future data)
   - Successfully retrained model without leakage

### 🔧 Recent Fixes for Trading Signals

The system was running but not showing trading signals. Fixed by:

1. **Added prediction threshold to config.yaml:**
   ```yaml
   prediction_threshold: 0.01  # Lower threshold for more sensitive signals
   ```

2. **Enhanced paper trading output** to show:
   - Prediction values (scaled and unscaled)
   - Signal generation (1=buy, -1=sell, 0=hold)
   - Position and balance tracking
   - Detailed logs every 10 iterations

3. **Root cause:** The retrained model (without target leakage) produces much smaller predictions than the original flawed model. The default threshold of 0.5 was too high.

### 📊 System Architecture

```
main.py (entry point)
├── collect: L2 data collection from Bybit
├── train: Model training pipeline
├── trade --paper: Paper trading simulation
└── backtest: (not yet implemented)

Core Components:
- datahandler.py: L2 data loading and processing
- featureengineer.py: L2 microstructure feature generation
- modeltrainer.py: LightGBM training (now leak-free)
- modelpredictor.py: Signal generation with threshold
- advancedriskmanager.py: Position sizing
- smartorderexecutor.py: Order execution
```

### 🚀 How to Run

1. **Check system status:**
   ```bash
   python diagnose_signals.py
   ```

2. **Run paper trading with enhanced output:**
   ```bash
   python main.py trade --paper
   ```

3. **If needed, check prediction distribution:**
   ```bash
   python check_predictions.py
   ```

### 📈 Expected Behavior

With the fixes applied, you should see:
- Prediction details logged every 10 seconds
- Trading signals when model confidence exceeds threshold
- BUY/SELL orders with position sizes
- Running position and balance updates

### 🔄 Pending Tasks (Phase 3-4)

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Fix Bybit WebSocket reconnection
   - Handle missing L2 data systematically
   - Implement data quality checks

2. **Database:**
   - Standardize schema for features table
   - Add indexes for performance
   - Implement data retention policies

3. **Model & Execution:**
   - Add ensemble models
   - Implement stop-loss/take-profit
   - Add performance metrics dashboard
   - Real-time model retraining

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- The model is now trained WITHOUT future information leakage
- Performance will be more realistic but likely lower than before
- The system uses only L2 order book features for predictions
- Paper trading is safe and doesn't affect real funds

### 💡 Tips for Better Performance

1. **Collect more data:** Run `python main.py collect --duration 60` for longer datasets
2. **Tune hyperparameters:** Modify optuna_trials in config.yaml
3. **Adjust threshold:** Lower for more trades, higher for more selective trades
4. **Monitor predictions:** Use check_predictions.py to understand model behavior
