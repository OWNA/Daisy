QUESTIONS FOR DEEP.PY TO HELP REDIRECT/IMPROVE CODING DIRECTION
================================================================================

Based on the amendments and analysis, here are key questions to ask Deep.py:

1. **Visualization Success**: "Now that we have L2 visualizations working (order book heatmap, microstructure features, data quality dashboard), what additional visualizations would be most valuable for monitoring L2 trading performance?"

2. **Missing Component**: "The advancedriskmanager.py file is missing and blocking backtesting. Should we recreate it from scratch or search for it in backup directories? What risk management features are essential for L2 trading?"

3. **Data Quality**: "With 37.56% data quality and many missing order book levels, should we focus on improving data collection or building models that are robust to missing data?"

4. **Next Priority**: "With visualization complete, should we prioritize: (a) finding/recreating advancedriskmanager.py, (b) testing the end-to-end pipeline, or (c) improving data quality?"

5. **Performance Optimization**: "The ETL processes 500 records/batch efficiently. For real-time L2 trading, what's the optimal balance between batch size and latency?"

6. **Model Training**: "We have 68,932 valid training targets from 519,104 records. Is this sufficient for training a robust L2 trading model, or should we collect more data first?"

7. **Integration Testing**: "What's the best approach to test the complete pipeline (data → features → model → trading) without the risk management component?"

8. **Real-time Requirements**: "For production L2 trading, what are the critical latency requirements for each component (data collection, feature generation, prediction)?"

9. **Monitoring Strategy**: "Beyond the current visualizations, what real-time monitoring and alerting should we implement for a production L2 trading system?"

10. **Failover Strategy**: "How should the system handle L2 data feed interruptions or quality degradation in production?"
