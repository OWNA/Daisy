Migration Guide: Integrating Enhanced Features
==============================================

This script demonstrates how to integrate the enhanced FeatureEngineer
with your existing trading pipeline while maintaining backward compatibility.

The enhanced FeatureEngineer adds approximately 40+ new features:
- Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) at multiple timeframes
- Weighted book pressure metrics
- Microstructure stability indicators

All existing 84 features remain unchanged.
