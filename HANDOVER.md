# Handover Notes for Gemini CLI Session (Trading Bot Project)

## Date: July 6, 2025

## Project Directory: `C:\Users\simon\Trade`

## Summary of Current Session

This session focused on executing a full end-to-end workflow of the L2 trading bot, from data collection to training and simulation. While the integration tests were successfully fixed, the full workflow is blocked by a critical issue in the data pipeline.

## Key Blocker: Data Pipeline Failure

The primary problem is a logical flaw in how the data alignment script (`align_l2_data.py`) interacts with the data collection script (`run_l2_collector.py`).

1.  **Mismatched Time Windows:** The `run_l2_collector.py` script is configured to collect L2 data for a very short duration (currently 20 seconds for testing).
2.  The `align_l2_data.py` script then attempts to find L2 data that corresponds to the most recent 1-minute OHLCV candle.
3.  Due to these mismatched and non-overlapping time windows, the alignment script almost never finds corresponding L2 data.

**Consequence:** This leads to the creation of an empty feature file. The `data_upload_manager.py` sees this empty file, calculates its hash (which is always the same), and incorrectly concludes that the data has already been processed. As a result, no data is ever uploaded to the database, and the `run_training_simple.py` script fails because it cannot find any data to train on.

## Attempts to Fix

Multiple attempts were made to resolve this, including:
*   Repeatedly clearing the database and data directories.
*   Modifying the `data_upload_manager.py` to ensure all tables were cleared.
*   Attempting to use a historical Parquet file (which was found to contain only OHLCV data).

These attempts failed because they did not address the root cause of the time window mismatch.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

To move forward, the data alignment logic must be fixed. The recommended solution is to make the alignment script "smarter":

1.  **Modify `align_l2_data.py`:** The script should first inspect the collected L2 data files to determine the actual start and end timestamps of the available data.
2.  **Fetch Corresponding OHLCV:** Using this determined time range, the script should then fetch the corresponding OHLCV data. This guarantees that the L2 data and OHLCV data will overlap.
3.  **Proceed with Pipeline:** Once the data is correctly aligned and uploaded, the rest of the training pipeline should execute successfully.

This approach fixes the fundamental logic flaw and will provide a robust solution for the data processing pipeline.
