# HHT Trading Discussion Summary

## Initial Question: EMD Libraries for Real-time L2 Trading Data

**Libraries Compared:**
- **PyEMD**: Most mature, good performance, active development
- **PyHHT**: More faithful to original Hilbert-Huang Transform methodology
- **CEEMD**: Better noise robustness, computationally expensive, available in PyEMD

**Recommendation**: PyHHT for mathematically faithful HHT implementation, despite maintenance challenges.

## Key Insight: True Hilbert-Huang Transform

**PyHHT vs PyEMD for HHT Fidelity:**
- **PyHHT**: Implements full HHT pipeline as originally conceived by Huang et al.
- **PyEMD**: Primarily focused on EMD decomposition step, lacks full Hilbert spectral analysis

**True HHT Process:**
1. EMD decomposition → Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs)
2. Hilbert transform of each IMF → Instantaneous amplitude/frequency  
3. Hilbert spectrum construction

## Training Environment Challenges (Colab + LightGBM/Optuna/SHAP)

**PyHHT Shortcomings:**
- Performance bottlenecks
- Memory management issues
- Integration complexity

**Solutions:**
- Precompute HHT features offline with heavy caching
- Process data in chunks rather than tick-by-tick
- Extract statistical features from IMFs instead of raw decompositions
- Create hybrid feature sets for Optuna optimization

## Live Trading Architecture

**Target Market**: BTC/USDT Perpetuals
**Analysis Focus**: Real-time bid/ask spread changes (normalized) + L2 derived features

### Why Stale HHT Approach is Problematic for BTC Perps:
- Funding rate changes every 8 hours create regime shifts
- Liquidation cascades alter market microstructure in seconds
- Cross-exchange arbitrage creates rapid spread changes
- Whale activity instantly changes order book dynamics

### Recommended Architecture:

**Multi-Resolution HHT Pipeline:**
- Fast buffer: 500 ticks (30s-1min) for regime detection
- Medium buffer: 2000 ticks (5-10min) for trend analysis
- Event-triggered recalculation on significant market changes

**Feature Strategy:**
```
Real-time features (sub-second):
- Spread normalized
- Orderbook imbalance  
- Microprice
- Volatility proxy

HHT context (30s-2min updates):
- Market regime detection
- Volatility cycle phase
- Noise vs signal ratio
```

**Key Principle**: HHT informs risk management and position sizing, not entry/exit timing.

## Resource Requirements

**Hardware Needs:**
- **Minimum**: 4-core CPU, 8GB RAM
- **Recommended**: 6-8 core CPU, 16GB RAM
- **Memory Usage**: ~1-2MB baseline
- **CPU Usage**: ~20-35% of single core

**Cost Options:**
- Local hardware: $500-1000
- VPS: ~$30/month (2-4 vCPU, 4-8GB RAM)

## Optimization Strategies

1. **Lazy HHT Computation**: Skip during quiet market periods
2. **Incremental Updates**: Cache results when market structure unchanged
3. **Resource Monitoring**: Adaptive processing based on CPU/memory usage
4. **Event-Triggered Recalculation**: Update on significant market structure changes

## Implementation Phases

**Phase 1**: Basic real-time L2 features only
**Phase 2**: Add simple HHT every 2-3 minutes
**Phase 3**: Optimize based on performance data

## Key Takeaway

For BTC/USDT perps trading, use HHT to provide market regime context while relying on real-time L2 features for millisecond-level decisions. The architecture is moderately resource-intensive but manageable with proper optimization.
