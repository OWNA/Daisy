# Quick Unicode Fix and Setup Guide

## âœ… Problem Fixed!

The Unicode encoding error was caused by special arrow characters (â†’) in the agent files. I've fixed:

1. **Updated `setup_trading_agents.py`** - Now uses UTF-8 encoding
2. **Cleaned Unicode characters** - Replaced â†’ with -> 
3. **Updated batch files** - Better encoding handling

## ðŸš€ Try Again Now

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Script
```cmd
# Run this - it should work now
fix_and_setup.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```cmd
# Set UTF-8 encoding first
chcp 65001

# Then run setup
python setup_trading_agents.py
```

### Option 3: PowerShell (if still having issues)
```powershell
# In PowerShell, run:
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"
python setup_trading_agents.py
```

## ðŸ”§ If You Still Get Errors

### Quick Debug:
```cmd
# Check Python version
python --version

# Check current encoding
python -c "import sys; print(sys.getdefaultencoding())"

# Force UTF-8 and run
set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
python setup_trading_agents.py
```
