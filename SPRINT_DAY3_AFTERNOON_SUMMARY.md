## 📈 Performance vs Morning Projections

| Metric | Morning Projection | Afternoon Actual | Status |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| False Signal Reduction | 25-35% | Not tested yet | Pending |
| Slippage Reduction | 30% | 51.5% | ✅ Exceeded |
| Fill Rate | 92-95% | 75% (3/4 strategies) | ⚠️ Below |
| Trading Costs | -1 to -2 bps | 6.5 bps | ❌ Needs work |

**Note:** Cost reduction needs more passive execution opportunities
