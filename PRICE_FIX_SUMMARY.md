# Bitcoin Price Fix Summary

## Issue Found
The paper trading was showing unrealistic BTC prices of $771,004 because:
1. The L2 snapshot processor was setting missing price levels to 0
2. This caused the feature engineer to calculate incorrect weighted prices
3. The position sizing was calculating in USD but displaying as BTC

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed L2 Snapshot Processing (datahandler.py)
- **Before**: Missing price levels were set to 0
- **After**: Missing levels extrapolate from the last available price
  - Bid levels: Use last bid price minus incremental spread
  - Ask levels: Use last ask price plus incremental spread
  - Fallback: Use mid_price * 0.99 for bids, * 1.01 for asks

### 2. Added Price Sanity Check (main.py)
- Added validation: BTC price must be between $10,000 and $200,000
- Logs warning and skips trade if price is unrealistic

### 3. Fixed Position Sizing (main.py)
- Fixed risk manager call to use correct parameters
- Added volatility estimate (2% for BTC)
- Convert USD position size to BTC units correctly
- Track both position (BTC) and balance (USD) separately

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Shows position size in both BTC and USD
- Displays current position and remaining balance
- Logs prediction details every 10 iterations

## Testing the Fix

1. **Verify price processing:**
   ```bash
   python test_price_fix.py
   ```

2. **Run paper trading with fixes:**
   ```bash
   python main.py trade --paper
   ```

## Expected Results
- BTC prices should be realistic (~$60,000-70,000 range)
- Position sizes should be reasonable (e.g., 0.01-0.1 BTC)
- No more 1000 BTC position sizes
- Balance should decrease when buying, increase when selling

## If Issues Persist
1. Check if exchange is returning valid orderbook data
2. Verify API connection to Bybit
3. Run `python check_predictions.py` to ensure model is working
4. Check logs for "Unrealistic BTC price detected" warnings
