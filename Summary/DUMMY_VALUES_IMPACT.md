# Impact of Dummy Values on Model Performance

## Why This Affects Performance

### 1. Feature Importance
The model learned patterns from these features during training:
- `id` - Probably not important (just row identifier)
- `target_*` values - **VERY BAD** - These are future values that leak information
- `close` - Might be important if different from mid_price
- `data_quality_score` - Could affect predictions if model learned to trust high-quality data more

### 2. Information Leakage
The biggest issue is that the model was trained with **target leakage**:
- `target_return_1min` - The actual future return (1 min ahead)
- `target_return_5min` - The actual future return (5 min ahead)  
- `target_volatility` - Future volatility
- `target_direction` - Future price direction

**This means the model learned to "cheat" by looking at future values!**

### 3. Performance Impact

With dummy values (all zeros), the model:
- ❌ Can't use the future information it was trained to rely on
- ❌ Will likely make poor predictions
- ❌ May default to predicting near-zero values
- ⚠️ Trading signals will be unreliable

## How Bad Is It?

To check feature importance:
```python
import lightgbm as lgb
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load model
model = lgb.Booster(model_file='trading_bot_data/lgbm_model_BTC_USDTUSDT_l2_only.txt')

# Get feature importance
importance = model.feature_importance(importance_type='gain')
feature_names = model.feature_name()

# Plot top 20 features
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 8))
indices = importance.argsort()[-20:]
plt.barh(range(len(indices)), importance[indices])
plt.yticks(range(len(indices)), [feature_names[i] for i in indices])
plt.xlabel('Feature Importance (Gain)')
plt.title('Top 20 Most Important Features')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('feature_importance.png')

# Check if target features are in top features
target_features = ['target_return_1min', 'target_return_5min', 'target_volatility', 'target_direction']
for i, idx in enumerate(indices[-10:]):  # Top 10
    feature = feature_names[idx]
    if feature in target_features:
        print(f"WARNING: {feature} is #{i+1} most important feature!")
```

## The Right Solution

### Option 1: Retrain the Model (Recommended)
```python
# When preparing training data, exclude target columns from features
features_for_training = [col for col in df.columns 
                        if col not in ['target', 'target_return_1min', 'target_return_5min',
                                     'target_volatility', 'target_direction', 'id', 
                                     'timestamp', 'symbol', 'exchange']]
```

### Option 2: Check Feature Importance First
Run the importance check above. If target features are not in the top 20, the impact might be minimal.

### Option 3: Use Predictions Carefully
- Use very small position sizes
- Monitor performance closely
- Retrain ASAP with clean features

## Bottom Line

- **Current model is compromised** due to target leakage
- **Predictions will be unreliable** with dummy values
- **Don't trade real money** with this model
- **Retrain the model** without target features for production use

The model essentially learned to "predict" by looking at the answer, so without the answer (dummy values), it's like taking a test without studying!
