# Model Filename Fix Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Results Variable Error
The error about `results` being undefined was misleading - it was actually happening because I had removed the booster.save_model() call, but ModelTrainer already saves the model internally. Fixed by removing the duplicate save.

### 2. Model Filename Mismatch
**Problem:** 
- ModelTrainer saved: `lgbm_model_BTC_USDTUSDT_l2_only.txt`
- main.py looked for: `lgbm_model_BTC_USDT_USDT.txt`

**Root Cause:**
- ModelTrainer uses `.replace(':', '')` (removes colon)
- main.py was using `.replace(':', '_')` (replaces colon with underscore)
- ModelTrainer adds `_l2_only` suffix
- main.py wasn't adding the suffix

**Fix Applied:**
Updated main.py to match ModelTrainer's pattern exactly:
```python
# From: symbol.replace('/', '_').replace(':', '_')  → "BTC_USDT_USDT"
# To:   symbol.replace('/', '_').replace(':', '')   → "BTC_USDTUSDT"

# From: f"lgbm_model_{safe_symbol}.txt"
# To:   f"lgbm_model_{safe_symbol}_l2_only.txt"
```

## Expected Files After Training

With symbol `BTC/USDT:USDT`, the system will create:
- `lgbm_model_BTC_USDTUSDT_l2_only.txt` (model file)
- `lgbm_model_BTC_USDTUSDT_l2_only_scaling.json` (scaling parameters)
- `model_features_BTC_USDTUSDT_l2_only.json` (feature list)

## To Verify

After training, run:
```powershell
python check_model_files.py
```

This will show you exactly what model files were created.

## Complete Pipeline Test

```powershell
# Train model
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py train

# Check what files were created
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe check_model_files.py

# Run paper trading
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py trade --paper
```

The filename mismatch is now fixed!
