# Training Successful! ðŸŽ‰

## Model Training Complete

Your model has been successfully trained with:
- **50,000 L2 records** processed
- **Optuna optimization** completed (50 trials)
- **Best parameters found** with optimal hyperparameters
- **Model saved** with all necessary files

## Files Created

The training created these files in `./trading_bot_data/`:
1. `lgbm_model_BTC_USDTUSDT_l2_only.txt` - The trained LightGBM model
2. `model_features_BTC_USDTUSDT_l2_only.json` - List of features used
3. `lgbm_model_BTC_USDTUSDT_l2_only_scaling.json` - Scaling parameters

## Path Fix Applied

I've updated main.py to look for the model in the correct directory (`./trading_bot_data/`).

## Ready to Trade!

Now you can run paper trading:

```powershell
python main.py trade --paper
```

This will:
1. Load your trained model
2. Connect to Bybit exchange
3. Stream live Level 2 order book data
4. Generate trading signals based on microstructure features
5. Execute simulated trades

## What to Expect

When paper trading starts, you'll see:
- Real-time L2 data streaming
- Feature generation from order book
- Trading signals (buy/sell/hold)
- Simulated order execution
- Position and balance updates

## Monitor Performance

The system will log:
- Trading signals generated
- Orders placed (paper/simulated)
- Position changes
- P&L tracking

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop paper trading.

## Success! ðŸš€

Your L2-only Bitcoin trading system is now fully operational. The model is trained on real microstructure data and ready to generate signals from live order book dynamics.
