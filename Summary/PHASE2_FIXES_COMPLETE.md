# Phase 2 Fixes Complete

## Errors Fixed

### 1. AttributeError: 'DataHandler' object has no attribute 'l2_raw_data_path'
**Solution:** 
- Removed references to `l2_raw_data_path`
- Rewrote `_load_historical_l2_data()` to scan `./l2_data/` directory for files

### 2. AttributeError: 'FeatureEngineer' object has no attribute 'engineer_features'
**Solution:**
- Changed `engineer_features()` to `generate_features()` in main.py
- Added logic to use mid_price as close for label generation

### 3. Database Table Issue
**Solution:**
- Changed query from `l2_training_data` (1000 records) to `l2_training_data_practical` (519k records)
- Increased training data limit from 1000 to 50000 records

## Current Status

The pipeline now correctly:
1. Loads L2 data from database (up to 50k records from 519k available)
2. Generates microstructure features
3. Should be able to train a model

## To Run

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py train
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py trade --paper
```

## What Happens Now

When you run `python main.py train`:
1. Loads 50k L2 records from database
2. Generates features (spread, imbalance, volatility, etc.)
3. Creates labels for supervised learning
4. Trains LightGBM model
5. Saves model as `lgbm_model_BTC_USDT_USDT.txt`

The system is now ready for testing!
