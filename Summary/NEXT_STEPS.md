# Next Steps - System is Ready!

## ✅ Virtual Environment Fixed
The virtual environment is now working correctly. All imports are successful.

## Current Status
- ✅ Virtual environment: Working
- ✅ All dependencies: Installed
- ✅ Code structure: Fixed
- ❌ Model: Not yet trained

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Train the Model
```powershell
python main.py train
```

This will:
1. Load 50,000 L2 records from your database (519k available)
2. Generate microstructure features
3. Train LightGBM model using Optuna optimization
4. Save model as `lgbm_model_BTC_USDTUSDT_l2_only.txt`

Expected output:
- "Loading L2 data..."
- "Loaded 50000 L2 records from database"
- "Generating L2 features..."
- "Training LightGBM model..."
- "Best Optuna params: {...}"
- "Model saved to lgbm_model_BTC_USDTUSDT_l2_only.txt"

### Step 2: Run Paper Trading
```powershell
python main.py trade --paper
```

This will:
1. Load the trained model
2. Connect to Bybit exchange
3. Stream live L2 order book data
4. Generate trading signals
5. Execute paper trades (simulated)

## Training Time Estimate
- With 50k records and Optuna optimization: ~5-15 minutes
- Depends on your CPU and number of Optuna trials (default: 50)

## Quick Checks

### Check if model exists after training:
```powershell
dir lgbm_model_*.txt
```

### Check training data availability:
```powershell
python check_database.py
```
Should show: "Table l2_training_data_practical: 519104 records"

## Troubleshooting

If training fails:
1. Check if database exists: `dir trading_bot.db`
2. Check config.yaml has correct settings
3. Reduce data size if memory issues: Change 50000 to 10000 in main.py

If paper trading fails after training:
1. Check model file was created
2. Ensure Bybit API credentials are set (if using real connection)
3. Check internet connection for exchange data

## Summary
Your system is now properly set up and ready to use. Just run the training command to create the model, then you can start paper trading!
