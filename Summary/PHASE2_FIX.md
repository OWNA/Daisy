# Phase 2 Fix Applied

## Fixed Issue
The error `'DataHandler' object has no attribute 'l2_raw_data_path'` was caused by:
1. We removed the `l2_raw_data_path` attribute during cleanup
2. The `_load_historical_l2_data()` method still referenced it

## Solution Applied
1. Updated print statements to use `l2_data_path` instead of `l2_raw_data_path`
2. Rewrote `_load_historical_l2_data()` to:
   - Load from the `./l2_data/` directory
   - Automatically find and load .jsonl.gz files
   - Load up to 5 most recent files or 100k records
   - Handle both gzipped and plain files

## To Run (Windows PowerShell)

Since you're on Windows, use the Python directly:
```powershell
# Activate virtual environment first
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Then run commands
python main.py train
python main.py trade --paper
```

Or without activating venv:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py train
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py trade --paper
```

## Next Steps
The training should now work. If successful, you'll see:
- "Loading L2 data..."
- "Found X L2 data files. Loading most recent..."
- "Generating L2 features..."
- "Training LightGBM model..."

The fix addresses the immediate error. Phase 3 will handle:
- Feature persistence to database
- Better error handling
- Data validation
